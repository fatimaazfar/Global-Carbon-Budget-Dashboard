# Global Carbon Budget Visualization Project - SOFTEC 2024 Winner

## Overview
This project presents a detailed analysis and visualization of the Global Carbon Budget (GCB) 2022 data, focusing on global carbon emissions, sinks, and their implications over time. By leveraging Python's Pandas for data manipulation and employing Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Google Looker Studio for visualization, this work explores, analyzes, and visualizes the dynamics of carbon emissions and absorption capacities globally.

## Data Sources
The project utilizes the GCB 2022 dataset, which includes comprehensive data on fossil emissions, land-use change emissions, and various carbon sinks. The data covers a wide temporal span, offering insights into historical trends and current states of global carbon budgets.

## Feature Engineering
The project introduces several engineered features to deepen the analysis:

- **Total Emissions**: Aggregates fossil emissions, land-use change emissions, and cement carbonation sinks.
- **Total Sinks**: Sum of ocean and land sinks, including cement carbonation, illustrating absorption capacity.
- **Emissions to Sinks Ratio**: Highlights the balance between emissions and sinks' capacity.
- **Fossil Fuel Proportions**: Details the share of coal, oil, and gas in total emissions, indicating energy reliance patterns.
- **Yearly Change in Emissions**: Examines the trends and pace of emissions growth or reduction.
- **Atmospheric Growth Change**: Analyzes acceleration or deceleration in atmospheric carbon accumulation.
- **Fossil Fuel Diversity and Carbon Intensity**: Measures the diversity and efficiency of fossil fuel usage.

For national fossil carbon emissions, additional features include total global emissions aggregation, emissions growth rate, sink efficiency, and cumulative emissions, offering a global perspective and historical impact analysis.

## Key Visualizations and Insights
The project's visualizations provide profound insights into the dynamics of carbon emissions and absorption:

- **Trend Analysis**: Observes the historical trends of total emissions and sinks, indicating global efforts' effectiveness.
- **Fossil Fuel Emissions Comparison**: Highlights the relative contributions of coal, oil, and gas to total emissions.
- **Emissions to Sinks Ratio**: Reflects on the balance between emissions and the capacity of sinks.
- **Atmospheric and Emissions Growth Changes**: Investigates the fluctuations in atmospheric CO2 and annual emissions growth rates.
- **Sink Efficiency**: Assesses the efficiency of carbon sinks over time, underlining their role in mitigating climate change.
